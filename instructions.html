    <h3>How to play?</h3>
    <p>The game is quite simple. Press the deal button when you would like your card to be flipped over. If your card is higher than the computer's card you win that battle and get to keep both of those cards. If yours is lower the computer takes the cards. If you and the computer play the same card, war is declared. Both players will play three cards and flip the third one over. Whoever's card is higher will recieve all of those cards.</p>
    <h3>How to win?</h3>
    <p>In order to survive this war, you must be the one with all of the cards.</p>
