# This_Is_War
A card game called war

<strong>Instructions</strong>
<hr>
This is a game against a computer. You start off on the home page and have an option to either read the instructions or start the game. Once you start the game, the cards will be shuffled and split to each player. The player then presses deal and if the player's card has a higher value than the computer's card the player wins that round. However, if the player's card is lower than the computer's card, the computer wins that round. Whoever wins that round collects the both cards that were played. If there is a tie between the computer's card and the player's card this is a WAR. The player and computer then deals two more cards faced down and flips then another face up that card is then determined who the winner is and the winner gets to keep all the cards. If there is another tie this WAR is repeated until someone wins. In order to start the WAR battle (the tie) the player must click a button that appears at the bottom called tie battle.

<strong>How I Made the game?</strong>
<hr>
First, I created the deck of 52 cards using a for loop. I then created functions that would shuffle and split the deck between the computer and player. I then created a deal button that would flip over the next card for both the computer and the player and then had multiple functions checking to see who won or if there was a tie for that round.
